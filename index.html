            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>"To discover, understand, and cure -- all through data." says Andy. <br />
                My name is Yuzhe Chen, and I am also known as Andy. 
                I am a graduate student at Tsinghua University, passionate about learning and analysis of biomedical data, especially neuroscience data.
                My motivation comes from the desire to understand the mechanism of the human mind and body, as well as the longing to care for myself and others, and neuroscience helps me to achieve such purposes.
                My research analyzes dynamic brain connectivity using statistical learning and signal processing methods, 
                through which I want to model the time-varying brain topology. I have been working on discovering the brain transition patterns and statistical metrics of neurological disorders. <br />

                <!-- Growing up, I was not the healthest kid, and I always though about changing that. 
                There have been countless efforts of improving my feeling and physicality, 
                but there are also two important moments where I realized that things can be improved: 
                When I started to go to the gym, I realized 
                When I learned about neuroscience, I realized my feelings can be improved, and some of that can translate to physical health.
                As for math and statistics, I feel like it just never left me, I did my bachelor's in EE, and my master's in DS.
                Now, seeing other people going through what I went through -->
                Besides research, I also like sports, music, learning languages, and meeting people from diverse backgrounds. <br />

                <h3>Project 1: Time-varying brain state transition analysis using physics-inspired graph measures</h3>
                <p>Employed a sliding window approach to construct time-varying brain networks.<br />
                    Analyzed dynamic functional connectivity by importing concepts from thermodynamics.<br />
                    Uncovered brain state transition mechanisms by identifying outliers and extreme values in thermodynamic quantity measures.<br />
                    Tested the correlation between temperature spikes and brain state transitions and verified the statistical significance of such correlation.<br />

                <h3>Project 2: Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis using Topological and Graph Theoretical Methods</h3>
                <p>Processed EEG and fMRI data of neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, etc.<br />
                    Applied graph theory and topological data analysis to extract brain state networks and study temporal brain state organization.<br />
                    Studied graph/simplicial spectral features and statistical measures of the dynamic connectivity of neurological disorders.<br />
                    Examined differences in distributions of brain temporal statistics for different subject groups.<br />

                <h3>Project 3: Cancer Gene Expression Data Analysis using Graph Signal Processing</h3>
                <p>Applied graph signal processing and graph frequency filtering techniques to extract cancer gene expression features.<br />
                    Employed dimension reduction and clustering algorithms (Gaussian Mixture, Spectral Clustering, K-Means, etc.) to model subject data.<br />
                    The Gaussian Mixture binary clustering accuracy reached higher than 97% for control vs. lung/stomach/colon cancer groups.<br />
